# Step 4 - Find ideas on Etsy 游꾸游꾸游꾸游꾸
# You are out of ideas for Christmas and you want to find inspiration from Etsy. Add a new action idea to your menu (additionally to the list, add, delete and mark actions). Here is how this action could work:


# WHEN "idea"
# puts "What are you looking for on Etsy?"
# search_item = gets.chomp

# ...

# puts "here are your Etsy results for #{search_item}"
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# puts "pick number to add to your list"
# 2
# "vintage jeans added to your list"
# What are you looking for on Etsy?
# > Jeans
# Here are Etsy results for "Jeans":
# 1 - Levis Blue Jeans
# 2 - Vintage Jeans
# 3 - Cargo Jeans Pants
# 4 - White Jeans
# etc.
# Pick one to add to your list (give the number)
# > 2
# "Vintage Jeans" added to your wishlist
# For the scraper, here is a starting script to help you extract the data:

# # scraping_etsy.rb
# require "open-uri"
# require "nokogiri"

# puts "What are you searching on Etsy?"
# article = gets.chomp

# # 1. We get the HTML file thanks to open-uri
# file = open("https://www.etsy.com/search?q=#{article}")

# # 2. We build a Nokogiri document from this file
# doc = Nokogiri::HTML(file)

# # 3. We search every elements with class="card" in our HTML doc

# doc.search(".card").each do |card|
#   # 4. for each element found, we extract its title and print it
#   title = card.search(".card-title").text.strip
#   puts title
# end
# Feel free to scrape another website adapting this script.
# Also, you can scrape other information than just the name (for example the price of the item).
